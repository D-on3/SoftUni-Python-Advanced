Python Advanced - may 2022

https://softuni.bg/trainings/3704/python-advanced-may-2022

The Python Advanced course builds on Python language skills by exploring more complex concepts typical of the language. In the course you will learn to create linear data structures, to solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), you will work with stacks and queues (Stacks & Queues), tuples and sets (Tuples & Sets), matrices (Multidimensional Lists), as well and files and directories. Attention will be paid to the functional programming paradigm. You will take a deeper look at recursive functions and functions with multiple arguments. The development environment that will be used by the training team is PyCharm, but each trainee is free to use tools of preference.
\
- Skills you will acquire
- Working with two-dimensional data structures
- Creating linear data structures
- Application of basic algorithms
- Application of functional programming
- Work with data streams, files and directories
- Error handling



Python OOP - June 2022

https://softuni.bg/trainings/3705/python-oop-june-2022

The Python OOP course will teach you the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes and objects, using object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies. Basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism will be studied. We will go into the most commonly used design patterns (creational, structural and behavioral design patterns). We will be introduced to SOLID principles for object-oriented software design. We will learn what iterators and generators are and how to use them. We will learn how to create and use decorators. We will focus on unit testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).

- Skills you will acquire
- Understanding the object-oriented programming paradigm
- Application of the principles of object-oriented programming
- Creating a class hierarchy and inheritance
- Unit testing
- Working with iterators and generators
- Working with decorators
